The Story
=========
There are these wonderful people in your life (Pearls) and you want to always remember important dates in their lives (Pearl Dates), probably to give them a call or send them a gift. To show the love, the care and honour you have for them. So you decided to build a system that enables you to keep track of these dates.

Steps to Automation
===================
1. Preliminary Investigation - How it works in real life 
	(understanding/identifying a problem) 
2. System Ana - breakdown the problem in to unit parts
3. Design the solution (the real deal, software engineering is about)
4. Choose a language and other tools
5. Translate the solution into codes 
	Implement/automate (coding/programming)
6. Test, debug, document, maintain
